# How to Install Angular: A Step-by-Step Guide

If you're looking to start building modern web applications, Angular is a powerful framework that offers tools and libraries for creating scalable and maintainable web apps. In this guide, I'll walk you through the steps of installing Angular on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Angular, ensure that you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js**: Angular requires Node.js for running the development server and managing packages.
   - Download Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm comes bundled with Node.js. You will use npm to install Angular CLI.
